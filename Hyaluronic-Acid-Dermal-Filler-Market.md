In recent years, demand for hyaluronic acid-based treatments has surged, driven by technological advancements, broader accessibility, and changing consumer attitudes towards aesthetics. However, as we move into the 2023-2033 period, industry trends and consumer preferences are shifting, creating new opportunities and challenges for this market.
